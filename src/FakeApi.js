Successful Journey engineers enjoy exploring the why of the product in addition to the how. Recognizing that customer experience is pivotal to the success of a product or service is also a requirement for this job.

Direct experience with our current software tools is not a prerequisite, but proven experience with a strongly-typed language in a production environment is desired. You must have an understanding of system architecture, particularly when it comes to redundancy and reliability. You take pride in your work and want to grow, both at Journey and in your career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe successful candidate will be a self-starter, an engineer who seeks to understand and discover and an engineer who has a desire to become part of a highly empowered team with a deep understanding of our product, our market and the key metrics of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have been working on web projects for long enough that you reminisce \u0026amp; complain about the old days of Javascript.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou feel very confident building React apps using Redux.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou have extensive experience with a strongly-typed language in a production environment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

Denk aan de mogelijkheid voor aangifte via internet, informatieve websites als politie.nl en de servicemodule 0900-8844. Maar ook aan Burgernet en Amber Alert waarmee we burgers vragen mee te helpen bij calamiteiten. Je werkt aan oplossingen die deze kanalen nóg toegankelijker maken. En je denkt mee over hoe we nieuwe technologieën kunnen inzetten voor de communicatie met het publiek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAls IT-projectmanager ben jij de kartrekker bij de realisatie en implementatie van de oplossingen door de scrumteams.

Ook signaleer je de belangrijkste issues. Voor het management van de Dienst ICT ben je een van de adviseurs over onder meer kosten, processen en risico's.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWat jouw functie nóg uitdagender maakt: je stelt de roadmap op voor oplossingen en borgt de samenhang van de (deel)architecturen voor applicaties en infrastructuur. Daarbij kijk je ook naar de toekomst. Vanuit de productielijn onderzoeken we hoe we met bijvoorbeeld omnichannel-instrumenten en artificial intelligence de communicatie tussen burgers en de politie verder kunnen optimaliseren. Jij verkent de technologische ontwikkelingen op de markt die daarvoor in aanmerking komen en vertaalt die naar het werkveld van onze organisatie. Zo draag jij achter de schermen bij aan het motto van de politie: waakzaam en dienstbaar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoed om te weten: omdat je tweede- en derdelijns vraagstukken kunt oplossen, draai je mee in 24/7-piketdiensten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWaar ga je werken?\u003c/strong\u003e\nHet Productiehuis bouwt met zeven productielijnen aan een betrouwbare en flexibele informatievoorziening die de operationele politiemedewerkers ondersteunt.

Met multidisciplinaire DevOps-teams beheren, verbeteren en vernieuwen we die tientallen applicaties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJe gaat als IT-projectmanager aan de slag in het Systemteam dat de beide clusters van de productielijn technisch ondersteunt. Daarbij richt jij je, binnen de lijnen die de domeinarchitect heeft uitgezet, op de diensten voor digitaal politiecontact vanuit de buitenwereld. Je krijgt de vrijheid om binnen de gestelde kaders voor de beste, slimste en snelste oplossing te gaan. Voor vragen kun je niet alleen bij de domeinarchitect van de productielijn terecht, maar ook bij andere experts onder de ongeveer duizend collega’s binnen het Productiehuis.

En als geen ander ben je in staat om zowel je collega’s uit de multidisciplinaire teams als interne opdrachtgevers mee te nemen in jouw oplossingen. Bovendien kun je gemakkelijk wisselen van abstractieniveau en perspectief, en afwijkingen op de architectuur en voorschriften inzichtelijk maken. Ook kun je helder communiceren, goed netwerken en vlot onderbouwde beslissingen nemen. En altijd heb je oog voor de klant.

We are very focused on project management and keeping large and complex projects moving smoothly. We have a fantastic team and culture and a ‘near-zero’ turnover.
